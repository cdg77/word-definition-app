## Description

_{ This application has a list words that display on the homepage.  Each word has a definition that can be viewed by a user if they wish by simply clicking on that word. This app is for my learning and testing purposes so I can't promise it's any good or will even work... I am not responsible if you copy it and it makes your stuff blow up ;0) }_

## Setup

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Are there other applications this app depends on?}_

## Technologies Used

_{Tis app uses the technologies : Ruby, Capybara, Sinatra, Heroku... among others }_
